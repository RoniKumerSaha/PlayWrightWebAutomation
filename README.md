# PlayWright Automation Testing for Web and API
This is a sample project where I have used PlayWright as a framework for performing Website and API automation testing. I have also added basic visual testing in this project.

To run the tests thare are multiple options/scripts/commands noted in package.json file

## Steps:
1. Install Node JS
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`
3. To run UI tests: `npm run test`
4. To run API tests: `npm run test_api`
5. To run visual tests: `npm run test_visual`
